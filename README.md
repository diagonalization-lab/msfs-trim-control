# Trim Adjustment for MSFS

It can be hard to  adjust elevator trim with a keyboard or joystick button in
MSFS. When you hold a key or button down, the trim first adjusts very slowly,
and then far too quickly to be controllable (just like holding a key down while
typing).

This panel addon has the following features:

1. It allows you set a maximum elevator trim update rate,
2. It binds the water rudder key to reset elevator trim to zero, and
3. It shows the current elevator trim value in the panel.

The panel does not need to be open, unless you actually want to see the trim
value or adjust the maximum trim update rate.
